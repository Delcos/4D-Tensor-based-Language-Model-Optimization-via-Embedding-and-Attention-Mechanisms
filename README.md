# Language Model Optimization via Embedding and Attention Mechanisms Using 4D Tensors

(This is a work in progress storage and details repo. Please use this for reference or if you have any questions. Code will be added once complete.)

This repo is for the 4DOPT project for highly flexible large language models and focuses on improving the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models. We utilize 4D tensors as the primary input to our model, allowing us to capture a richer and more complex representation of the input data. To further improve the quality of our model, we employ embedding techniques to encode the input text into a lower-dimensional representation that preserves the semantic relationships between words. Additionally, we leverage attention mechanisms to dynamically adjust the weights assigned to different parts of the input sequence, allowing the model to focus on the most important information. By combining these techniques, we aim to create an NLP model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of tasks, including text classification and language generation.

Our optimization methodology involves the application of a novel regularization scheme that leverages the properties of 4D tensors to achieve enhanced generalization performance. Specifically, we utilize a combination of L1 and L2 regularization techniques to impose a sparsity constraint on the weights of our model, thereby reducing the potential for overfitting to the training data. To further improve the optimization process, we employ a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with adaptive learning rates that dynamically adjust based on the gradient variance. Our model also employs dropout, which rand
omly drops out a portion of the neural network units during each iteration, further reducing overfitting and increasing the model's robustness. We evaluate the performance of our model using a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art models on several benchmark datasets.
