# Language Model Optimization via Embedding and Attention Mechanisms Using 4D Tensors

***This is a work in progress storage and details repo. Please use this for reference or if you have any questions.***

This repo is for the 4DOPT project for highly flexible large language models and focuses on improving the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models. We utilize 4D tensors as the primary input to our model, allowing us to capture a richer and more complex representation of the input data. To further improve the quality of our model, we employ embedding techniques to encode the input text into a lower-dimensional representation that preserves the semantic relationships between words. Additionally, we leverage attention mechanisms to dynamically adjust the weights assigned to different parts of the input sequence, allowing the model to focus on the most important information. By combining these techniques, we aim to create an NLP model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of tasks, including text classification and language generation.

Our optimization methodology involves the application of a novel regularization scheme that leverages the properties of 4D tensors to achieve enhanced generalization performance. Specifically, we utilize a combination of L1 and L2 regularization techniques to impose a sparsity constraint on the weights of our model, thereby reducing the potential for overfitting to the training data. To further improve the optimization process, we employ a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with adaptive learning rates that dynamically adjust based on the gradient variance. Our model also employs dropout, which rand
omly drops out a portion of the neural network units during each iteration, further reducing overfitting and increasing the model's robustness. We evaluate the performance of our model using a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art models on several benchmark datasets.

## API:

To facilitate seamless integration into user applications, we provide our optimized language model via a RESTful API that exposes a variety of endpoints for tasks such as text classification and language generation. To utilize our API, users may submit HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoint, with the input text as a parameter. The API, then returns the results of the requested task as a JSON object, which users can incorporate into their applications. When structuring their program, users should consider the size of the input text and ensure it conforms to the optimal length for the model's input layer. ***Additionally, the NATE team (or others) should consider the implications of tokenization and ensure the input text is properly tokenized before submission to the API.*** It is also recommended that users apply additional pre-processing techniques, such as sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition, to ensure optimal performance of the model. Users should take note of the API's rate limits and formulate requests accordingly.


The exact shape of the tensor required by the language model will depend on the specific architecture of the model and the input it expects. In this case it is using F16. Please be aware of this and use the below as a reference:


    batch_size is the number of input sequences you want to process at once
    sequence_length is the length of each input sequence
    embedding_size is the size of each token embedding


If your input tensor does not have the correct shape, you will need to reshape it to match the expected input shape of the language model. You may also need to preprocess your input data to ensure that it is in the correct format before passing it to the language model. This can be as simple as taking the user's input and removing any special characters and formatting. It shouldn't be too much of an issue.
