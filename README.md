# 4D-Tensor-based-Language-Model-Optimization-via-Embedding-and-Attention-Mechanisms

This repo is for the 4DOPT project for highly flexible large language models and focuses on improving the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models. We utilize 4D tensors as the primary input to our model, allowing us to capture a richer and more complex representation of the input data. To further improve the quality of our model, we employ embedding techniques to encode the input text into a lower-dimensional representation that preserves the semantic relationships between words. Additionally, we leverage attention mechanisms to dynamically adjust the weights assigned to different parts of the input sequence, allowing the model to focus on the most important information. By combining these techniques, we aim to create an NLP model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of tasks, including text classification and language generation.
